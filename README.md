# Oops

This repo is just used by me when demonstrating the features of GitHub and Git with those who are unfamiliar or unsure.

It's bascially for messing around, but I have tried to give it some form of frame and structure to help when it comes to adding content. It is based on the premise of a very bad team recording their very poor, and not to be copied standards, processes, and general day-to-day info.

## Welcome to OOPS

The Office of Operators, Practioners and Stuff or OOPS is a team focused on developing a more blue-sky approach to holistic policy contingencies.

There is an abundance of synergy in the market place and we are approaching critical mass so we're planting the seeds, watering the crops, and then our competitors are eating our lunch.

This repository is a place where we store our team processes, standards, and information about the team.
