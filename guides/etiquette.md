# Etiquette

To ensure homgenous team working and enthusiastically transform real-time partnerships we have produced this guide on team ettiquette.

## Avoid idle gossip

If the gossip is informative and interesting then that is acceptable. Ensure you share it with as many people as possible so no team member feels left out.

We believe gossip is good for morale, however refrain from idle (boring and uninformative) gossip.

## Use your own mug

On starting with OOPS you are expected to provide your own mug (the standard for mug selection is not yet written so please speak to a colleague for details before purchasing one).

You should only ever use your own mug and not that of a colleagues. You may handle another colleagues mug but only once you have received written permission to do so. Email confirmation is acceptable.

## Cake restraint

On officially appointed days, a colleague may bring a cake into the office for the team. **DO NOT** go back for seconds until everyone in the team has had a slice. This includes those on annual leave, away from the office, or those on long term sick.
